### Project Specs

The objective of this exercise is to take expense data, and display useful analytics on it, so a customer can see how much they spent over the month. This will simulate a somewhat realistic product that may be useful for a customer. Style is not important, but afterward you could definitely make it look pretty as a bonus!

The requirements are broken into three main phases; all three are not expected within an hour, however finishing them all will be good practice. Try to get through the first 2.

Expense data is passed in as props.expenses as one long string, of the format "Type:Amount Type:Amount Type:Amount"
i.e. "ATM:10 Gas:45.21 McDonald's:8.49"

Your objective is to modify expenses.js to implement the following functionality:

Phase 1: display the total number of times each expense occurred (for example, the count of how many times an ATM expense occurred), as well as the total spent on that expense. There should also be one entry for All Expenses, that shows data for everything.

Phase 2: Add columns for Average (Mean), Min, and Max for each type, as well as All Expenses.

Phase 3 (Bonus): Add columns for the Median and Mode of each type.

Extra Bonuses: Sort by column type (asc/desc) on click, Styling, Testing.


You may need to npm install.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
